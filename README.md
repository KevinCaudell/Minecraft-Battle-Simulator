# Minecraft-Battle-Simulator in Python
A Minecraft themed battle simulator built using Python to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, modular game logic, and randomized combat mechanics.

# Features
- Player vs Mob combat system
- Multiple battle rounds + gamemodes
- Custom character classes using inheritence
- Level up progression system
- Ability cooldown & counter mechanics
- Randomized attacks for dynamic, unpredictable battles
- Polymorphic ability & attack handling
- Modular & reusable code


# Skill Demonstrated
# - Object-Oriented Programming #
  - Classes & Objects
  - Inheritences (Custom classes / built-in classes)
  - Polymorphism 
  - Encapsulation
  - Modular class design
  - Dunder methods
- Game state & combat loop architecture
- Randomized combat algorithms.
- Loop and state management
- Modular project structure
- Code organization & readability

# Technologies Used
- Python
- OOP architecture
- random module (combat variation)
- time.sleep() battle pacing
